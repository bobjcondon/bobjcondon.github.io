# Bob Condon's Projects

This is a holding page until I make some decisions about how to deploy my vanity projects.


## Bridgeserver

Bridgeserver is a web-based application for hosting a local bridge clubs.   Think of it as a 
replacement for BridgeWebs but written with modern webtools.
Currently it uses nextjs.
